# On That Note
Last updated 5/17/23 (app version 0.9.0)

### What is it? ### 
On That Note is an app designed to build fine motor skills in children ages 2-7 years old.

### How does it work? ###
Kids can select an instrument (currently only piano) and then “song” or “free play” mode.
- In “song” mode, some parts of a song are played by the app and other parts are played by the user. This helps to build waiting skills as well as fine motor skills.
- In “free play” mode, the user can play the instrument on their own.

### What are the potential benefits of this app? ### 
- Allows kids to practice fine motor skills like tapping and lifting fingers (piano) and swiping (shaker)
- Builds emotional skills like waiting
- “Free play” mode gives music therapists and caregivers a tool to use when purchasing musical instruments is difficult
- Allows music therapists to assess a client’s skills with a mobile device, which may be helpful when a client is a candidate for a digital communication system
- Kids enjoy using it!

### Who built this app? ### 
Katy Barrus, a senior at South Kingstown High School, built this with help from Jeongyeon Hwang, a music therapist at [Hands in Harmony](https://hihri.org) in Kingston, RI.
